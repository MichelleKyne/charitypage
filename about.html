            <h3><b>About us</b></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that cycling can play a really positive role in developing a sense of freedom and mobility for refugees / newcomers who have come to Ireland. Often they feel isolated in their accommodation. Cycling can help newcomers to explore their new living environment.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The intention of Wildcat Bike School is to create a sense of hope to those who have lost their homes and find themselves in a new, unfamiliar environment. It also provides a great opportunity to build intercultural connections.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Wildcat Bike School wants to help build confidence amongst those who might need it most. Cycling has so many positive aspects: it provides a source of transport, a means of keeping fit and a sense of independence. Learning a new skill is always welcome and the feeling of shared accomplishments between the trainer and the trainee can't be beaten! This common goal leads to the reduction of fear of contact on all sides. It's just a hell of a lot of fun. For everyone involved.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We have taken our inspiration from <a href="https://bikeygees.org">#BIKEYGEES e.V.</a> in Berlin, which started in September 2015 as a small empowerment project. It has since grown into a non-profit association for education and integration work and were recognised as such in May 2016.</p>
