Website title: Wildcat bikes

This is a website for a fictional organisation that teaches adults/refugees how to cycle. 
The idea was taken from an organisation I volunteered with in Germany called BikeyGees. 

Please find below information referencing the assignment requirements:

Links to both your own pages and external webpages. 
The links for the index, about, contact, events and gallery pages are in the navigation bar and on the website title text. 
Links to two external websites, www. volunteer.ie and www.bikeygees.org are on the contact and about pages respectively.

A navigation bar.
The navigation bar is available on every page of the website for ease of navigation.

At least one table used in an appropriate manner.
The table is on the events page.

At least one list (ordered or unordered).
An unordered list was used for the navigation bar, which appears on every page of the website.

At least one local or embedded video.
An embedded YouTube video can be found on the index page.

At least four CSS3 and four HTML5 specific elements.
CSS3 examples: text-align, font-size, transform, padding, margin, color, display, background-color.
HTML5 examples: <ul>, <li>, <a>, <div>, <p>, <img>, <h3>, <footer>.

Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float).
The position property was used for the banner image, the footer, and the video.
The float property was used for the col- classes, the unordered list and the images on the index page.

Make use of both inline and block elements.
Inline elements such as <a>, <img>, <b>, <i> were implemented.
Block elements such as <div>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <footer> were used throughout.
